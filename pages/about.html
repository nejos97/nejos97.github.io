            I am Nenba Jonathan, student (from time to time) in Computer Science at the University of Ngaoundéré in Cameroon. I am the third born of a family of 5 children. I have 2 beautiful older brothers (😘 Abel and 😘 Isaac) and 2 beautiful younger brothers. I did most of my secondary education in Guider (a department located in the North of Cameroon).</p>

            In eighth grade, I was lucky enough to be seduced by computers. I enjoyed spending a lot of time in the multimedia resource center of our school accompanied by my dear friends (🖥️ Dany, 🖥️ Andre, 🖥️ Alladin). Since then, I've really dedicated myself to computers and everything that revolves around them.

            After obtaining my Baccalaureate, I passed the UIT (University Institute of Technology) exam where I trained in Computer Engineering which, after two years, resulted in obtaining a University Diploma of Technology After that, I enrolled in Faculty.

            I wanted to be independent and have enough time to do what I wanted. I like computers but not the way the courses are taught. After thinking long and hard about my future and what people around me wanted from me, I decided to go for it and do what I really liked.
          </p>

          <p>
            I decided to be an IT and Entrepreneur. I will continue to learn new skills (Don't they say that you learn all your life?).

            I created this website to share my passion with people from all over the world and learn from them as well. Photography, reading, writing and music are my passion. This website will make you discover all of this. Do not hesitate to share it with your friends and family.
